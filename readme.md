The code is used to find the pharmacophore feature, feature coordinates, radius of tolerance and vector of each Pharmacophore features.<br>

Pharmacophore features ==> Aromatic,Hydrogen Bond Donor, Acceptor, Positive Ion, Negative Ion and Hydrophobic. <br>

features.py ==> Can find the Pharmacophore features present in any ligand along with their heavy atoms of that feature based on the substructure of ligand. <br>

radius.py ==> specifies the radius of tolerance sphere of any pharmacophore feature.<br>

coordinates_generation.py ==> retrive the coordinates of each atom of a ligand and can calculate the coordinate of Pharmacophore feature present in that ligand.<br>

vector.py ==> calculates the vector for Hydrogen bond Donor, Acceptor and Aromatic interactions.<br>

The ligand.sdf file is the input for all the codes mentioned above<br>
